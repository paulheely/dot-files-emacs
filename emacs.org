#+TITLE:  Emacs Configuration File
#+AUTHOR: Paul Heely


* Introduction

  This is my =.emacs= file ... well, the top-level of it anyway.
  I've written it in a [[http://www.orgmode.org][literate style]], to make it easy to explain.
  The notes also include hyperlinks to where I stole it. ;-)

** Loading this File

   To "load" the contents of this file, add the following to =$HOME/.emacs=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
     ;; Load our Literate Programming version of our Dot Emacs
     (unless (boundp 'aquamacs-version)
       (load-file "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-main.el")
       (server-start))
   #+END_SRC

* General Settings
** Directory Structure

   In case this is the first time running this on a computer, we need
   to make sure the following directories have been created.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (let* ((subdirs '("elisp" "backups"))
            (fulldirs (mapcar (lambda (d) (users-emacs-directory d)) subdirs)))
       (dolist (dir fulldirs)
         (when (not (file-exists-p dir))
           (message "Make directory: %s" dir)
           (make-directory dir))))
   #+END_SRC
