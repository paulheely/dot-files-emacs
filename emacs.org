#+TITLE:  Emacs Configuration File
#+AUTHOR: Paul Heely


* Introduction

  This is my =.emacs= file ... well, the top-level of it anyway.
  I've written it in a [[http://www.orgmode.org][literate style]], to make it easy to explain.
  The notes also include hyperlinks to where I stole it. ;-)

** Emacs Executable

   While I often use [[http://emacsformacosx.com/builds][Emacs for Mac]], lately, I've been building Emacs
   from source using [[http://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]. I start by adding the following dependency:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     brew cask install xquartz
   #+END_SRC

   *Note:* I've been running into an issue where I want Emacs to display
   ligatures as well as work with the visual regular expression
   package.  To get the both to work, I find I need to build from
   source after applying [[https://github.com/minimal/emacs/commit/812dd5119645a09bc025a9dddedad9474d12ecb6][this patch]]. According to the Homebrew
   documentation (see [[https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Formula-Cookbook.md#patches][the Patches section]]), we first:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     brew edit emacs
   #+END_SRC

   And add the following section

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   patch do
     url "https://github.com/minimal/emacs/commit/812dd5119645a09bc025a9dddedad9474d12ecb6.diff"
   end
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   And then build from source especially for the Mac:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     brew install emacs --HEAD --use-git-head --with-cocoa --with-gnutls --with-librsvg --with-ns --with-imagemagick

     brew linkapps emacs
   #+END_SRC

   Not only does this install the latest version of Emacs in
   =/usr/local/bin/emacs=, but it also links a GUI version in
   =/Application/Emacs.app=.

   All Homebrew options for Emacs can be seen with the command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     brew options emacs
   #+END_SRC

** Loading this File

   To "load" the contents of this file, add the following to =$HOME/.emacs=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
     ;; Load our Literate Programming version of our Dot Emacs
     ;; file, from file: ~/Work/dot-files/emacs.org
     (unless (boundp 'aquamacs-version)
       (load-file "~/.emacs.d/elisp/init-main.el")
       (server-start))
   #+END_SRC

   I only load this from a "normal" Emacs distribution, which
   allows me to play around with [[http://aquamacs.org/][Aquamacs]] and [[http://eschulte.github.io/emacs-starter-kit/][Starter Kits]].
   You know, to see what I may be missing.

* General Settings
** My Directory Location

   Normally, the =user-emacs-directory= stores everything in a
   =.emacs.d= directory in the home directory, however, Aquamacs
   overrides that, and since I now feel the need to use these settings
   for both editors (sure feels like XEmacs all over again).

   Any way, I have a new global variable for that:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (defconst ha/emacs-directory (concat (getenv "HOME") "/.emacs.d/"))

     (defun ha/emacs-subdirectory (d) (expand-file-name d ha/emacs-directory))
   #+END_SRC

** Directory Structure

   In case this is the first time running this on a computer, we need
   to make sure the following directories have been created.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (let* ((subdirs '("elisp" "backups"))
            (fulldirs (mapcar (lambda (d) (ha/emacs-subdirectory d)) subdirs)))
       (dolist (dir fulldirs)
         (when (not (file-exists-p dir))
           (message "Make directory: %s" dir)
           (make-directory dir))))
   #+END_SRC

** Customization Section

   While I would rather program my configurations, sometimes the Emacs
   menu system is "good enough", but I want it in its own file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" ha/emacs-directory))
     (when (file-exists-p custom-file)
       (load custom-file))
   #+END_SRC

** Setting up the Load Path

   Extra packages not available via the package manager go in my
   personal stash at: =$HOME/.emacs.d/elisp=

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (add-to-list 'load-path (ha/emacs-subdirectory "elisp"))
   #+END_SRC

** Modernizing Emacs

   With a long history of working on small machines without gigabytes
   of RAM, we might as well let Emacs be the beast it has always
   dreamed.

   First, letâ€™s increase the cache before starting garbage collection:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (setq gc-cons-threshold 50000000)
   #+END_SRC

   Found [[https://github.com/wasamasa/dotemacs/blob/master/init.org#init][here]] how to remove the warnings from the GnuTLS library when
   using HTTPS... increase the minimum prime bits size:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (setq gnutls-min-prime-bits 4096)
   #+END_SRC




* Technical Artifacts

** Setting up the Exec Path

   Make sure that =PATH= variable for finding binary files can is the
   same as what Emacs will look for binary files. This little magic,
   starts up a shell, gets its path, and then uses that for the
   =exec-path=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (when window-system
       (let ((path-from-shell (shell-command-to-string "/bin/bash -l -c 'echo $PATH'")))
         (setenv "PATH" path-from-shell)
         (setq exec-path (split-string path-from-shell path-separator))))
   #+END_SRC

** Configure the Graphical Settings

   If we are running in a windowed environment where we can set up
   fonts and whatnot, call the 'mac' stuff... which will still work
   for Linux too.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
     (if (window-system)
        (require 'init-client)
      (require 'init-server))
   #+END_SRC

** Load up the Local Configuration

   Before we finish, we need to check if there is a local file for us
   to load and evaluate.  We assume the local file has been tangled
   and provides the =init-local= key:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
     (require 'init-local nil t)
   #+END_SRC

   Finally, let's get happy:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
     (defun display-startup-echo-area-message ()
       (ha/cookie))
   #+END_SRC

   After the first load, we can reload this with a require:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (provide 'init-main)
   #+END_SRC

   Before you can build this on a new system, make sure that you put
   the cursor over any of these properties, and hit: =C-c C-c=
